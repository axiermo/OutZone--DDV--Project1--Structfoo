· What is OutZone?
Outzone is a vertical-scrolling run & gun game.This type of games are very similar to shoot'em up but they are more focused in evading the shots of the enemy than on killing the NPCs and the movement it's set . 
To sum it up, you can win the game just killing a few enemies and the bosses, as you can just run towards the level boss while evading the enemies that you can.
In the game you control a cyborg created by humans deployed in a foe planet with th only mission of destroying them all, as they are invading the Earth.
